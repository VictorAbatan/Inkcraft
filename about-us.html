      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Inkcraft is a creative collective of writers and artists who believe in the power of storytelling.
        Whether through words or visuals, we craft experiences that resonate, inspire, and endure.
        What began as a small group of dreamers has grown into a vibrant universe of poets, novelists,
        illustrators, and digital creators. Our mission is simple: to amplify voices, celebrate originality,
        and spark imagination in all its forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        From immersive verses to stunning illustrations, each piece born at Inkcraft is a testament to our
        commitment to artistic freedom and expression. We don't just tell stories â€” we shape them, illustrate them,
        and bring them to life.
